# Histograms
A Python-based tool that processes post-AGB star and candidate catalogs, allowing users to search for specific stars using their Gaia ID. The program loads the catalogs , provides an interactive search bar, and enables users to locate stars by specifying specific values for their effective temperature logg and metalicity.
